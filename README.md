# Human-Pose-Estimation-using-Machine-Learning
Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Google Colab, Machine Learning, Deep Learning

This project focuses on real-time human pose detection and analysis using computer vision and machine learning techniques. By leveraging the MediaPipe Pose framework and OpenCV, I developed a system capable of detecting 33 human body landmarks to analyze movement patterns and exercise postures.

Key Contributions:

Developed a pipeline to process live video or images to extract and visualize skeletal structures.

Integrated MediaPipe Pose with OpenCV for real-time feedback on activities like yoga, running, and exercise routines.

Classified postures to detect correctness and form, with potential applications in fitness coaching and physiotherapy.

Addressed challenges such as occlusion, varying body types, and motion dynamics.

Conducted a comprehensive literature survey and implemented performance benchmarks.

Outcomes:

Created a functional system with real-time skeleton overlay and posture classification logic.

Contributed to a 30+ page technical report and showcased snapshots and animations of poses in motion.

Identified future research areas, including multi-person pose estimation and edge optimization for mobile deployment.

This project strengthened my expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and real-world application of AI in the health and fitness domain.
